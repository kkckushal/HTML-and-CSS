    <h5>A funny story:</h5>
    <p>"There was this one guy in my class that was constantly making fun of me. One day, after I couldnâ€™t take it any more, I pulled out my phone and acted like I was talking to snipers who were trained to follow around people who were mean to me. He thought it was for real."</p>
